                {/* The Founders of Raven Resumes started their career in Recruiting and Human Resources, where they worked with hiring managers from companies of all industries. Building rapport with these companies took a tailored approach, and often applicants applying to these jobs were not coached on how to apply to jobs and how to have the best shot at these jobs. This is why our founders took this knowledge, pivoted careers to gain data analytics skills, and built a platform for applicants.  <br /><br /> */}
